    <h1>Spacestation Game Ideas</h1>
    <p><small>Inspiration from games like Portal, Bioshock, Systemshock, Prey, The Witness, Outer Wilds</small></p>

    <p>You come across a strange space station while travelling through space. You've never seen anything like it before. It seems to have appeared from out of nowhere</p>

    <p>Game starts with you entering this strange space station. The place has been deserted. You are greeted by an AI speaking to you over the ships speakers</p>

    <p>Similar to a metroidvania there will be items that you find in each area which will allow you to access to new areas and open up shortcuts between areas.</p>

    <p>Game uses terminals and written notes to tell the story of the space stations passengers</p>

    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>A mysterious spacestation built for the purpose of scientific advancement. Each area of the spacestation has its own unique design and trials to overcome.</p>
